I am currently a final year PhD candidate in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin, where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Atlas Zhangyang Wang](https://express.adobe.com/page/CAdrFMJ9QeI2y/) in the [VITA](https://vita-group.github.io) research group. During my PhD study, I have worked closely with [Prof. Yingbin Liang](https://sites.google.com/view/yingbinliang/home) from The Ohio State University. Prior to my PhD study, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Statistics and Computer Science and Mathematics from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research interest mainly lies in deep learning theory and optimization. 

Currently, I am a visiting student at Princeton University since September 2023, hosted by [Prof. Jason D. Lee](https://jasondlee88.github.io).
